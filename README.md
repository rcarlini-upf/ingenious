# Ingenious Project

This is the main repository for the Ingenious European Project. 

This repository contains the different docker containers needed in order to run text-to-speech, translation and speech-to-text. Also, there is an integration component that allows to use all of the other from an integrated service.

In order to be able to run the services, you'll have to install docker and docker-compose.

Once you have those installed, run the following command in the base directory:
```
docker-compose up
```

The different services should be build and started and you'll find the integration interface in http://localhost:4100/ .
