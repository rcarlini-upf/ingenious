In order to run the tests, if you want to use the pyaudio library, you'll have to make sure to have portaudio installed before installing pyaudio.

In ubuntu, run the folowing command:
```
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev
```

After installing portaudio, install test_requirements.txt:
```
pip install -r test_requirements.txt
```
